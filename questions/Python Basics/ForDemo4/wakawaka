You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle
You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on, you feel it
But you got it all, believe it
When you fall, get up oh oh
And if you fall, get up eh eh
Zamina mina zangalewa1
'Cause this is Africa

Zamina mina, hé hé2
Waka waka, hé hé
Zamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
